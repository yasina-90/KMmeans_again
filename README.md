# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## Overview

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to cluster data points into groups based on their similarity. It's widely used for tasks such as data segmentation, pattern recognition, and data analysis.

## Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Choose the number of clusters (\( k \)) you want to identify in the data.
   - Randomly initialize \( k \) centroids (representative points) in the feature space.
   
2. **Assign Points to Clusters**:
   - Calculate the distance between each data point and each centroid.
   - Assign each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid (often using Euclidean distance).
   
3. **Update Centroids**:
   - After assigning all data points, update each centroid by computing the mean of the data points in its cluster.
   - The new centroid becomes the center of its cluster.
   
4. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat the assign-update steps until convergence (when centroids no longer change significantly) or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
   
5. **Final Clustering**:
   - Once the algorithm converges, each data point is assigned to one of the \( k \) clusters based on the final centroids.
